          <h1>Bangladesh</h1>
          <p>
            People's Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is
            the eighth-most populous country in the world, with a population
            exceeding 165 million people in an area of either 148,460 square
            kilometres (57,320 sq mi) or 147,570 square kilometres (56,980 sq
            mi),[7][13] making it one of the most densely populated countries in
            the world. Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the west,
            north, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast; to the south it has a
            coastline along the Bay of Bengal. It is narrowly separated from
            Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor; and from China by 100 km
            of the Indian state of Sikkim in the north..[14] Dhaka, the capital
            and largest city, is the nation's economic, political, and cultural
            hub. Chittagong, the largest seaport, is the second-largest city.
            The official language is Bengali, one of the easternmost branches of
            the Indo-European language family. Bangladesh forms the sovereign
            part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was
            divided during the Partition of India in 1947.[15] The country has a
            Bengali Muslim majority. Ancient Bengal was an important cultural
            centre in the Indian subcontinent as the home of the states of
            Vanga, Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and Harikela. The
            Mauryan, Gupta, Pala, Sena, Chandra and Deva dynasties were the last
            pre-Islamic rulers of Bengal. The Muslim conquest of Bengal began in
            1204 when Bakhtiar Khalji overran northern Bengal and invaded Tibet.
            Becoming part of the Delhi Sultanate, three city-states emerged in
            the 14th century with much of eastern Bengal being ruled from
            Sonargaon. Sufi missionary leaders like Sultan Balkhi, Shah Jalal
            and Shah Makhdum Rupos helped in spreading Muslim rule. The region
            was unified into an independent, unitary Bengal Sultanate. Under
            Mughal rule, eastern Bengal continued to prosper as the melting pot
            of Muslims in the eastern subcontinent and attracted traders from
            around the world.
